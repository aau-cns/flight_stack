## Tutorial

Please consult the [Wiki](https://github.com/aau-cns/flight_stack/wiki) for a detailed tutorial on installation, configuration, and usage.

## Setup and compile the project

```bash
# Get the ros package
git clone https://github.com/aau-cns/flight_stack.git cns_flightstack
cd cns_flightstack
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build the project
catkin init
catkin build
```

After building you can install the launch scripts with
```bash
sudo ./scripts/install_scripts.sh
```

Then, launching the flight stack is possible via

- `fs_remote <USER>@<IP>` to launch the flight stack remotely with user `ID` at the device with IP `IP`
- `fs_dev<1|2>` to launch the flight stack on device 1 or 2
- `fs_op` to launch the operator window, i.e., autonomy engine only

Please consult `fs_<SCRIPT> -h` for further information.

## Isolated Build with Docker

```sh
cd cns_flightstack # enter flight stack directory
docker build --network=host -t cns_flight_stack_test_env:latest docker/ # Build the Docker image

# The following runs the container, maps the source code (read only)
# and executes the script in 'docker/docker_application_test.sh'
docker run -it --rm \
  --network=host \
  -v "$(pwd)/src":/source:ro \
  cns_flight_stack_test_env:latest
```
Please do not forget to build your workspace inside the docker test container, as the source is just linked to your host.
